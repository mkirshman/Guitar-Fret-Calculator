# Guitar Fret Calculator

## Overview

The Guitar Fret Calculator is a React application designed to assist in calculating fret positions on a guitar neck based on the scale length and fret count. Additionally, it provides visual representation and the capability to generate G-code for CNC machining.

## Features

- **Fret Calculation:** Easily calculate and visualize fret positions for a given scale length and fret count.
- **Visual Representation:** View an interactive diagram of the guitar neck with highlighted fret positions.
- **G-code Generation:** Generate G-code for CNC machining to aid in creating fret slots accurately.

## Demo

Include a link to a live demo or a GIF/video showcasing the application's functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/guitar-fret-calculator.git
